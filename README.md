# Multilayer-Perceptron-Clinical-Prediction-Model
A multi-task deep learning model to simultaneously predict four clinical outcomes: cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, kidney damage (UACR), and liver inflammation (ALT). Built with a Multi-Output MLP on NHANES data, this project uses a unified model for holistic health risk assessment.
